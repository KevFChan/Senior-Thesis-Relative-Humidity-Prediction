The purpose of this Rmd file is to understand the naming sturcture that Lingzhi used to match the grids together.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
scaled_station <- readRDS("/Volumes/Seagate Portable Drive/Modeling_Data/3.0.Scaled_Station_predictor_all.rds")
grid_lonlat <- readRDS("/Volumes/Seagate Portable Drive/Modeling_Data/8.2.ERA_grid_resample_MODIS_grids_withLonLat.rds")
```


As we can see, the last value of x (7th) is the first value of grid.id and the last three values of y (5-7) is the three values after the "_" in grid.id. So we have x_y. With some more thinking, we can conclude that era.id is actually a count that was created by Lingzhi to label the ERA5 grids. So it seems we will need to obtain the grid.id first, use those to merge the era5 data 
```{r}
head(grid_lonlat)
```
